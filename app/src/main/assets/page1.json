It's a well known location that has been shot supremely by all the greats, including Ryan, Chip, and Marc.  \n\nSo why bother to post the shot then?  Well, I'lll tell you why.  I have a bone to pick, and it's a big one.  This shot was made during a whirlwind 1500+ mile 3 day road trip with my buddy Ryan Buchanan (RyBu... so as not to get mixed up with RyDy).  We scoured the entire state trying to find SOME sort of light, but it was one of those weird Oregon spring stretches where literally the entire NW was covered with nothing but clear skies.  We managed to track down a couple of clouds on this evening in what amounted to the only decent light on this trip.  I'm still cross because RyBu found a better comp than me during the twilight period.  This became a recurring theme during our little sojourn, hence I will never be inviting him on a photo trip again.  (Kidding if you don't know me well enough to know that... About not inviting him back.  Not about his comps.  He crushed my soul)  \n\nAnyway, back to the point.  So after this  evening we trekked down south and continued our futile attempt at finding good light for sunrise.  A busted morning later, we found a random spot for some breakfast and settled in with the locals for some eats.  We meander up, slowly swing the door open, and there they were.  It was like a scene straight out of the movies.  Golden spot light.  Angels singing.  I suddenly become much more tan.  In front of us was a gigantic tray of homemade, freshly baked muffins.  They were glorious.  I immediately spotted the Raspberry Chocolate Chip.  Amazing.  I could actually feel my saliva starting to generate.  We were seated quickly by an affable hostess, and given our menus.  Frankly I wasn't interested in anything but my muffin (that sounds just... wrong.  But you know what I mean).  Shortly thereafter, our delightful server came up and asked if we needed something to drink.  I might have casually mentioned that she really shouldn't be interested in RyBu's drink order whatsoever, but that I would like a Raspberry Chocolate Chip muffin please.  And one more for the road (which of course meant I would finish it before we left the parking lot).  I believe her exact words were \"Coming right up!\"\n\nThis is where things start to turn slightly darker.   The angelic light from the entrance turned stormy.  The music changed to more of a Mozart's Requiem kind of theme. She returned with RyBu's stupid coffee.  \n\n\"I'm sorry, we are sold out of the Raspberry Chocolate Chip Muffins\", she said cheerfully.  Suddenly her sunshiny attitude seemed far less charming.  \n\n\"What do you mean?  There were about 10 of them when I walked in 3 minutes ago!\"\n\n\"Yes\", she giggled (wipe that smile off your mouth, woman... I thought) \"Someone just came in and bought them all!  We are very well known for our muffins!\"  \n\nI had to settle for blueberry.  BLUEBERRY.  Yawn!!!   So average!!   So boring!!  \n\nPoint of the story, if you are the greedy b%stard that came in and ordered all the damned Raspberry Chocolate Chip Muffins, you are VERY lucky they wouldn't let me review the security camera footage.  THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANT RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS TOO, MR or MRS SELFISH!!\n\nYou may now proceed with your day.  And no, I will NOT disclose the location so you punks can go down and savor my muffins.  (I really do need to come up with a different phrase).  \n\nPSA, out.\n\nOh yeah, and before you ask:  Yes the birds are real, but no this certainly isn't one frame.  They were shot at a much faster shutter speed and longer focal length and then blended in to the scene.  Don't like it?  Bring me a freaking muffin and we can talk.","camera":null,"lens":null,"focal_length":null,"iso":null,"shutter_speed":null,"aperture":null,"times_viewed":11385,"rating":99.8,"status":1,"created_at":"2016-05-11T12:20:05-04:00","category":8,"location":null,"latitude":44.4971754,"longitude":-124.0826621,"taken_at":null,"hi_res_uploaded":0,"for_sale":false,"width":1200,"height":801,"votes_count":1767,"favorites_count":0,"comments_count":151,"nsfw":false,"sales_count":0,"for_sale_date":null,"highest_rating":99.8,"highest_rating_date":"2016-05-12T09:49:31-04:00","license_type":0,"converted":27,"collections_count":96,"crop_version":3,"privacy":false,"profile":true,"image_url":"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/153318041/q%3D50_w%3D140_h%3D140/3ccc7538f7576f5704ddebf268fd8f4c?v=3","images":[{"size":2,"url":"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/153318041/q%3D50_w%3D140_h%3D140/3ccc7538f7576f5704ddebf268fd8f4c?v=3","https_url":"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/153318041/q%3D50_w%3D140_h%3D140/3ccc7538f7576f5704ddebf268fd8f4c?v=3","format":"jpeg"}],"url":"/photo/153318041/psa-by-miles-morgan","positive_votes_count":1767,"converted_bits":27,"watermark":false,"image_format":"jpeg","user":{"id":122188,"username":"MilesMorganPhotography","firstname":"Miles","lastname":"Morgan","city":"Portland","country":"USA","usertype":0,"fullname":"Miles Morgan","userpic_url":"https://pacdn.500px.org/122188/a75d045c0d36d6b4d7429b777e85b618e288111b/1.jpg?119","userpic_https_url":"https://pacdn.500px.org/122188/a75d045c0d36d6b4d7429b777e85b618e288111b/1.jpg?119","cover_url":"https://pacdn.500px.org/122188/a75d045c0d36d6b4d7429b777e85b618e288111b/cover_2048.jpg?2","upgrade_status":0,"store_on":true,"affection":165325,"avatars":{"default":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/122188/a75d045c0d36d6b4d7429b777e85b618e288111b/1.jpg?119"},"large":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/122188/a75d045c0d36d6b4d7429b777e85b618e288111b/2.jpg?119"},"small":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/122188/a75d045c0d36d6b4d7429b777e85b618e288111b/3.jpg?119"},"tiny":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/122188/a75d045c0d36d6b4d7429b777e85b618e288111b/4.jpg?119"}},"followers_count":0},"licensing_requested":false},{"id":153312939,"user_id":2256367,"name":"Tuscany Awakening","description":"<a href=\"https://instagram.com/guerelsahin/\">INSTAGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"http://facebook.com/guerelsahinpictures/\">FACEBOOK</a>","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","lens":"","focal_length":"","iso":"","shutter_speed":"","aperture":"","times_viewed":12000,"rating":99.8,"status":1,"created_at":"2016-05-11T11:44:01-04:00","category":8,"location":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"taken_at":null,"hi_res_uploaded":0,"for_sale":false,"width":2000,"height":692,"votes_count":2370,"favorites_count":0,"comments_count":102,"nsfw":false,"sales_count":0,"for_sale_date":null,"highest_rating":99.8,"highest_rating_date":"2016-05-12T08:29:12-04:00","license_type":0,"converted":27,"collections_count":153,"crop_version":3,"privacy":false,"profile":true,"image_url":"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/153312939/q%3D50_w%3D140_h%3D140/d20bda9667bffce83a97a43f7aaf883d?v=3","images":[{"size":2,"url":"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/153312939/q%3D50_w%3D140_h%3D140/d20bda9667bffce83a97a43f7aaf883d?v=3","https_url":"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/153312939/q%3D50_w%3D140_h%3D140/d20bda9667bffce83a97a43f7aaf883d?v=3","format":"jpeg"}],"url":"/photo/153312939/tuscany-awakening-by-guerel-sahin","positive_votes_count":2370,"converted_bits":27,"watermark":false,"image_format":"jpeg","user":{"id":2256367,"username":"guerelsahin","firstname":"guerel","lastname":"sahin","city":"","country":"Germany","usertype":0,"fullname":"guerel sahin","userpic_url":"https://pacdn.500px.org/2256367/68eb50888772698be7f1be6188e99263442bb382/1.jpg?51","userpic_https_url":"https://pacdn.500px.org/2256367/68eb50888772698be7f1be6188e99263442bb382/1.jpg?51","cover_url":"https://pacdn.500px.org/2256367/68eb50888772698be7f1be6188e99263442bb382/cover_2048.jpg?83","upgrade_status":2,"store_on":true,"affection":308808,"avatars":{"default":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/2256367/68eb50888772698be7f1be6188e99263442bb382/1.jpg?51"},"large":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/2256367/68eb50888772698be7f1be6188e99263442bb382/2.jpg?51"},"small":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/2256367/68eb50888772698be7f1be6188e99263442bb382/3.jpg?51"},"tiny":{"https":"https://pacdn.500px.org/2256367/68eb50888772698be7f1be6188e99263442bb382/4.jpg?51"}},"followers_count":0},"licensing_requested":false},{"id":153353409,"user_id":591737,"name":"Half Full","description":"Horseshoe Falls\nTasmania\n\nI like a glass half full approach these days.

Saber","description":"instagram.com/the_blurred_lens\n\nAntelope Canyon… The name just invokes vision of a time past. I can picture the native people, walking through the canyon and looking up in utter amazement and sheer awe at the beauty that God has created. I envision them taking their young men to the canyon and teaching them about the history of their ancestors. Starting fires in the back of the canyon and telling stories of the great buffalo hunts. To me, this is what Antelope Canyon is. Now, let me tell you a different story. A story of what Antelope Canyon REALLY is.\n\nYou are driven down to the canyon in the back of a pickup truck packed like sardines in a can. Once you arrive at the canyon, you are given a set of very strict instructions on when and how to take photos. You are told that things move very fast and that you need to be ready to shoot your photo when your guide tells you. As you enter the mouth of the canyon, you are first struck with the beauty of the place. This is quickly destroyed by the throngs of tourist that are there. Imagine a canyon not much wider than a few feet filled to the brim with people. I tried to count the number of people in the first chamber and stopped when I got to a hundred. It is just a madhouse with everyone inside.\n\nAs you get to the first beam of light, your photo guide will ask who has the widest lens and will put those people in the front. I had my trusty 10mm with me so was put dead center in the front middle. Imagine the old war movies when a firing squad was about to execute someone. You had three rows of photographers lined up with their cameras pointing downrange waiting for the fire command. The guide will walk over to the beam and throw a handful of sand into it. He will then proceed to yell “FIRE!”. The cacophony of shutters firing is a juxtaposition of the scene you are looking at. You are allowed two minutes at each light beam, and at the end of those two minutes, you are ushered off to the next one. This photographers dance goes on for two hours and all the way through the canyon.\n\nWhile this is a magical place to see with your own eyes, it is a stark contrast to what I imagine it was like many years ago. It takes almost ballet style form to dodge all the selfie sticks waving around in the air. I saw a handful of people walk into the canyon wall since they were staring at their phones; no doubt posting pictures to Instagram. If you have never been to this area before, go; it is truly an amazing thing to see as the light beams split the canyon walls. Just do us all a favor and leave the selfie sticks in the car; that’s why God gave you arms, built in selfie sticks.","camera":"Canon EOS 7D","lens":"EF-S10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS
